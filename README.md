# Birds of Magdalena - eBird Data Analysis (2020â€“2025)

This repository contains code and data processing workflows for analyzing eBird observation data from the highly biodiverse Magdalena region of Colombia, 2020 to 2025. The notebook outputs a CSV file to then import into Tableau for visual analysis (the end product, an interactive Tableau story, is accessible [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/clara.hughes/viz/magdelena_birds_2020_2025/BirdsofMagdalena).) The main workflow is written as a Jupyter Notebook: `ebird_Magdalena_2020_25.ipynb`.

## Overview

The notebook demonstrates how to:

- Load large eBird datasets using both DuckDB (via SQL magics) and pandas.
- Explore the dataset structure and content.
- Create SQL views for efficient querying and filtering.
- Export processed results to a CSV file for further analysis in Tableau.
